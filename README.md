# HOW TO START THE WEBSITE
Step 1: Install Node.js for your OS.

Step 2: Install Docker for your OS.

Step 3: Clone the repo.

Step 4: Once Docker is installed, open the app (desktop version of Docker).

Step 5: In the root directory, navigate to docker-compose.yaml and run "services".

Step 6: Navigate to src/main/java and run the main method. Every time the main method is run, 31 nodes are inserted into the graph. The GUI for the database can be found at localhost:8081.

Step 7: Open a terminal and navigate to scr/main/frontend.

Step 8: Run the following command: "npm install". If this results in error messages, run "npm install --force" instead.

Step 9: Open the website by typing `npm start` in the terminal.

Step 10: Click "Update Nodes" and "Update Edges". You should now have a graph and be able to generate a word cloud when you press on a node.

# How the Backend Was Built

This tutorial was the main source of information used when building the backend, so watching it will give an understanding of the code and the code structure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssj0CGxv60k

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
